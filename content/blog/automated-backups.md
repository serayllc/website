**The Smart and Easy Way to Protect Your Data**

You can either tear out your hair when disaster strikes, or you can prepare ahead of time. Online backup services are one of the best ways to protect yourself against loss of computer data, whether it's caused by a crashed hard drive, unintentional deletion, natural disaster, or ransomware attack.

Our service technicians can install an online backup service on you PC that scans your drive for files which have changed since your last backup, encrypts them for security, and sends them up to high-storage-capacity servers attached to the internet. Once your files are stored on these cloud servers, they're available for you to view or restore to the device they came from.  

Online backup services are different from cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive. Simple Cloud storage services are not designed to automatically protect all your important documents and media files, including operating system files.
