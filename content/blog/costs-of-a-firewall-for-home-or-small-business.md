The trend of malware being directly targeted to homes and small businesses continues to grow. 2016 was the year of ransomware and 2017 has been no better. You need a secure network to protect your family and your business.

Here is a sample quote for a five user single location office with a local file server. This assumes that there is a basic network, PCs and a server in place.

Some of the items in the list may be optional, depending on your office.

pfSenseÂ® Security Appliance: $400    
Install and Configuration: $500

**Total:** $900   

With this configuration you gain the following:

* High-speed secure wireless with a captive portal option
* Modern firewall configured for maximum security
* Suricata IDS (Intrusion Detection System) that can be custom configured
* Multi-level malicious website protection and website content control
* Easy to configure VPN (Virtual Private Network) so you can access your files from home

We can of course modify this plan to fit your requirements.
