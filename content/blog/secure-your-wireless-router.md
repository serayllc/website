There are a number of steps you can take to stop a hacker from gaining entry to your home network.  

**Change administrator passwords**  
This is one of the most common points of entry for someone to gain access to your home network. The router you received from your ISP generally all come with a set number of Wi-Fi SSIDs and wireless keys – usually printed on the rear of the router. It doesn’t take a genius to trawl the internet and obtain a list of SSIDs and wireless keys used by that particular ISP. The fact that your router is near permanently advertising itself over the airwaves doesn’t help.

**Check wireless encryption method**  
Most routers come with encryption already active, but there are some examples where the default  encryption level may be extremely weak, or worse still, completely open. After logging in, if your router tells you the encryption method is anything other than WPA2, you need to change it.

**Change Default SSID Name**  
The SSID is the name of your wireless network. Your devices use the SSID to recognize previously used networks and will try to hook up to any matching network that they have stored login data for. With a default SSID, you’re potentially setting your devices up to connect to a lot of strange networks by default. Moreover, if the default SSID reveals your router, hackers might be able to identify the model, leading them to uncover router-based vulnerabilities of your network.

**Turn Off WPS**  
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless standard that makes it very easy to set up an encrypted wireless connection. To give a device access to your wireless network, you either press a button on both the router and your device or you enter the 4 to 8 digit number printed on a sticker on your router.

The problem is, this feature is turned on by default and since there are no limits to how many times you can enter a wrong code. With the right tools, it only takes a hacker minutes or hours to compromise your wireless network.  

**Change Default Router IP**  
To make it even harder for hackers to find your router’s admin panel, change the default IP address of your home network.  

**Disable Remote Administration or Management**  
When remote access is enabled, anyone on the Internet can access your router and change its settings. To prevent unsolicited remote access, you need to disable this feature. Note that this still allows anyone close enough to catch your Wi-Fi to access the admin panel, provided they know the login credentials. If you can, set your router to only permit access to the admin panel from a wired connection. This is a rare feature and you might have to upgrade or change your router firmware to get it.

**Switch to 5 GHz Band**  
The standard Wi-Fi band is 2.4 GHz, which travels further. By using the 5 GHz band you reduce the reach of your Wi-Fi network and thus the chance of a bad guy picking it up and trying to break in. It also decreases interference, improves speed, and increases stability of your network. Unfortunately, not all devices support the 5 GHz band.  

**Use static IP addresses**  
By default, your router automatically assigns an IP address to any device that connects to it. This is a great convenience, but allows hackers automatic access to your network once they crack the pass codes. For this reason, some system administrators assign an IP address to each device on the network individually.

**Adjust Router position**  
This simple act of network protection can be one of the best, if done correctly. By moving your router, you can limit the range of your wireless broadcast signal. If your router was located near the front of your home, for example, someone was moving down the road sampling wireless networks could find yours as they passed your house.  

**Switch off the router when you’re not using it**  
A lot of people have their router powered on all the time, regardless of whether they are in the house or not. If you’re not using the internet, or plan to be away for a while, it’s a good idea to power off the router.
